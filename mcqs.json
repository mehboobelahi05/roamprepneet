    "explanation": "During the charging process of the capacitor through a resistor connected to a battery, the current I in the circuit primarily flows through the resistor. Simultaneously, there is a changing electric field between the plates of the capacitor, which induces a displacement current. According to Ampere’s law with Maxwell’s addition, the displacement current is equal in magnitude to the conduction current (I) and flows in the same direction.",

Non-magnetic materials do not interact strongly with magnetic fields, so they would not require a force to hold them in place in front of a magnetic pole. C. Move the sheet away from the pole with uniform velocity if it is conducting. If the sheet is conducting and moving away from the pole with uniform velocity, then eddy current will produced in the sheet and an electromagnetic force of attraction will be generated. To overcome this force, we must apply some force. D. Move the sheet away from the pole with uniform velocity if it is both, non-conducting and non-polar.

In this case, malonate competes with succinate for binding to the active site of succinate dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle. As a result, malonate inhibits the enzyme’s ability to catalyze the conversion of succinate to fumarate, disrupting cellular metabolism.",

The action potential is conducted to the ventricular side by the AVN and AV bundle from where the bundle of His transmits it through the entire ventricular musculature (Purkinje fibres). Therefore, the correct pathway of conduction of action potential is SA → AV node → AV bundle → Bundle branches → Purkinje fibres.",
