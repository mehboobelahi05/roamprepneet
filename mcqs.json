    "explanation": "The wrong statement is that algin is obtained from red algae and carrageenan from brown algae; actually, it's the reverse—algin (alginate) is derived from brown algae (like kelp), while carrageenan comes from red algae. Algae do release oxygen via photosynthesis, agar-agar is from red algae like Gelidium and Gracilaria, and brown algae like Laminaria and Sargassum are edible in some cultures.",

Clones are from asexual reproduction, zoospores are motile spores in algae/fungi, and plantlets in potato/banana/ginger arise from nodes (eyes/buds) on modified stems (tubers/rhizomes), not internodes.",

However, their cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, glucans, and other polysaccharides, not purely cellulose as seen in plant cell walls. Cellulose may be present in some fungal groups but is not universal or the main component, making this statement incorrect.",

The egg has synergids with filiform apparatus (not the egg itself), antipodals are usually three (not numerous), and reduction division (meiosis) in megaspore mother cell produces haploid megaspores.",

However, their cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, glucans, and other polysaccharides, not purely cellulose as seen in plant cell walls. Cellulose may be present in some fungal groups but is not universal or the main component, making this statement incorrect.",

    "explanation": "The wrong statement is that all fungi possess a purely cellulosic cell wall. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can be unicellular (like yeast) or multicellular (like molds and mushrooms), and they are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment. However, their cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, glucans, and other polysaccharides, not purely cellulose as seen in plant cell walls. Cellulose may be present in some fungal groups but is not universal or the main component, making this statement incorrect.",

Diatoms are microscopic algae with cell walls (frustules) made of silica, which are highly durable and resistant to decay, allowing them to accumulate over time and form diatomaceous earth, a sedimentary deposit used in filtration and abrasives. They are major primary producers in oceans due to photosynthesis and float passively (planktonic) in water currents.",

    "explanation": "Conifers, such as pines and firs, thrive in harsh climates like cold, dry, or windy areas due to adaptations including needle-like leaves with a thick waxy cuticle that reduces water loss through transpiration and protects against freezing. Broad hardy leaves are not typical (they have narrow leaves), superficial stomata would increase water loss (conifers have sunken stomata), and they lack vessels (using tracheids for water transport instead).",

    "explanation": "Conifers, such as pines and firs, thrive in harsh climates like cold, dry, or windy areas due to adaptations including needle-like leaves with a thick waxy cuticle that reduces water loss through transpiration and protects against freezing. Broad hardy leaves are not typical (they have narrow leaves), superficial stomata would increase water loss (conifers have sunken stomata), and they lack vessels (using tracheids for water transport instead).",

Clones are from asexual reproduction, zoospores are motile spores in algae/fungi, and plantlets in potato/banana/ginger arise from nodes (eyes/buds) on modified stems (tubers/rhizomes), not internodes.",
