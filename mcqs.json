These include anaerobic conditions (absence of oxygen), such as in deep-sea vents or marshes; high salt concentrations, like in salt lakes or evaporation ponds (halophiles); extreme temperatures, ranging from boiling hot springs (thermophiles) to freezing polar regions (psychrophiles); and highly acidic pH levels, such as in acid mine drainage or volcanic soils (acidophiles). Their unique cell membrane lipids, which contain ether linkages instead of ester linkages found in other organisms, along with specialized enzymes and metabolic pathways, enable them to survive where most life forms cannot. Examples include Methanogens (which produce methane in anaerobic environments), Halobacterium (salt-loving), and Thermus aquaticus (heat-loving, source of Taq polymerase used in PCR). In contrast, Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria, Eubacteria are typical bacteria, and Streptococcus is a genus of bacteria that does not typically inhabit extreme environments.",

    "explanation": "Nitrogen fixation is a biological process where atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is converted into ammonia (NH3) or other nitrogenous compounds that plants can use. This process is carried out by certain prokaryotes, including some bacteria and archaea. Rhizobium is a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium that forms nodules on the roots of leguminous plants, converting N2 into usable forms for the plant in exchange for carbohydrates. Azotobacter is a free-living aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacterium found in soil, contributing to soil fertility. Some Cyanobacteria, like Anabaena and Nostoc, also fix nitrogen, often in symbiotic relationships with plants or in aquatic environments, using specialized cells called heterocysts. However, Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common gut bacterium, does not possess the nitrogenase enzyme complex required for nitrogen fixation and relies on organic nitrogen sources. Thus, while many bacteria contribute to the nitrogen cycle, E. coli is not among the nitrogen fixers.",

    "explanation": "In prokaryotic organisms like bacteria, there is no true nucleus bounded by a nuclear membrane, unlike in eukaryotes. Instead, the bacterial genome, which is typically a single circular chromosome composed of double-stranded DNA, is located in an irregularly shaped region within the cytoplasm known as the nucleoid. The nucleoid is not enclosed by a membrane but is a condensed area where the DNA is supercoiled and associated with proteins that help in organization and regulation. This region is distinct from other cytoplasmic components, such as ribosomes, which are involved in protein synthesis and are scattered throughout the cytoplasm. The nucleoid's structure allows for efficient replication, transcription, and regulation of genes in response to environmental changes. In contrast, the nucleus in eukaryotes is membrane-bound, cytoplasm is the fluid matrix, and ribosome-free regions do not specifically house the genome.",

    "explanation": "Fungi that specifically grow on animal dung or feces are classified as coprophilous (or caprophilous) fungi. These organisms play a crucial role in ecosystems by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and breaking down complex compounds in dung. Examples include species from genera like Pilobolus, which launches spores onto vegetation to be ingested by herbivores, continuing its life cycle, and various Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. The term 'coprophilous' derives from Greek words meaning 'dung-loving.' In contrast, tericolous fungi grow on soil, saxicolous on rocks, and saxiphilous might refer to rock-loving but is not standard for dung-inhabiting fungi. Coprophilous fungi are adapted to the nutrient-rich, moist environment of dung and often have specialized dispersal mechanisms.",

    "explanation": "Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that lack chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, making them heterotrophs—they rely on external sources for nutrition. Most fungi are saprotrophs (or saprophytes), obtaining nutrients by secreting enzymes to break down dead organic matter, such as decaying plants, animals, or waste, into simpler compounds that they absorb. This decomposition process is vital for nutrient cycling in ecosystems. While some fungi are parasitic, feeding on living hosts (e.g., rusts and smuts on plants), and others form symbiotic relationships (e.g., mycorrhizae with plant roots), the primary mode for the kingdom as a whole is saprotrophic. Autotrophs produce their own food via photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, which fungi do not do. Parasites specifically harm living hosts, but not all fungi are parasitic.",

This laid the foundation for modern taxonomy. Aristotle contributed early ideas on classification based on habitat and morphology but not systematic taxonomy.

Without the apical meristem, root growth in length would not occur, making it a universal feature in root development across plant species.",

So, to hold the place we must apply some force. B. Hold the sheet there if it is non-magnetic. Non-magnetic materials do not interact strongly with magnetic fields, so they would not require a force to hold them in place in front of a magnetic pole. C. Move the sheet away from the pole with uniform velocity if it is conducting. If the sheet is conducting and moving away from the pole with uniform velocity, then eddy current will produced in the sheet and an electromagnetic force of attraction will be generated. To overcome this force, we must apply some force. D. Move the sheet away from the pole with uniform velocity if it is both, non-conducting and non-polar. Since non-conducting and non-polar materials don’t interact significantly with magnetic fields, they wouldn’t require a force to move away from the pole with uniform velocity.",

In system A, liquid evaporates to vapours i.e., randomness increases automatically entropy increases. In system B, temperature is lowered i.e., randomness lowered and entropy also lowered. In system C, solid reactant gets convert into gas i.e., randomness increases and entropy also increases. In system D, molecule is converted into its corresponding atoms so randomness and entropy both increases. So, option (1) is correct.",

In competitive inhibition, a molecule (the inhibitor) binds to the active site of an enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding and thereby inhibiting the enzyme’s activity. In this case, malonate competes with succinate for binding to the active site of succinate dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle. As a result, malonate inhibits the enzyme’s ability to catalyze the conversion of succinate to fumarate, disrupting cellular metabolism.",

Morchella esculenta is an edible morel mushroom without hallucinogenic properties. Neurospora sp is a red bread mold used in genetic research but not hallucinogenic. Ustilago sp is a smut fungus that causes plant diseases and lacks such compounds. This makes Amanita muscaria the fungus with hallucinogens.",

Eubacteria (true bacteria) have membranes with straight-chain fatty acids linked by ester bonds. Modes of nutrition can be similar (both can be autotrophic or heterotrophic), cell shapes overlap (e.g., rods or spheres), and reproduction is primarily asexual binary fission in both. The fundamental difference lies in the cell membrane structure.",

Marchantia and Riccia are liverworts that do not form significant peat deposits. Funaria is a common moss but not associated with peat formation. Sphagnum's ability to hold water and create acidic conditions makes it the key contributor to peat, used as fuel or horticultural material.",

    "explanation": "Dr. F. Went's experiment, where agar blocks placed with oat coleoptile tips caused curvature in decapitated coleoptiles, is fundamentally significant as **it is the basis for the quantitative determination of small amounts of growth-promoting substances (auxins)**. This bioassay allowed for the precise measurement of auxin concentration based on the degree of bending. \n\n**Significance:** The method facilitated the quantitative analysis of growth-promoting substances.\n**Mechanism:** It demonstrated that the active substance moved from the tip into the agar and then into the stump.\n**Application:** It was later used to help isolate and identify auxins like IAA.",
