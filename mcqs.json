In the absence of light (darkness), these photoreceptors are depolarized, releasing neurotransmitters that continuously inhibit bipolar cells, leading to the transmission of signals to the visual cortex. When exposed to light, photoreceptors become hyperpolarized, reducing the release of neurotransmitters, which subsequently leads to the generation of action potentials and initiates visual signal processing in the brain. This process of depolarization in darkness and hyperpolarization in response to light allows for the perception of visual stimuli in varying light conditions.",

    "explanation": "Mismatch is (2) Rhodospirillum --- Mycorrhiza\n\n(1) Frankia --- Alnus: This is a correct match. Both Frankia and Alnus are involved in a symbiotic relationship where Frankia is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium living in nodules on the roots of Alnus trees. Frankia provides nitrogen to the tree, and the tree provides Frankia with carbohydrates and a protected environment.\n\n(2) Rhodospirillum --- Mycorrhiza: This is the mismatch. Rhodospirillum is a purple non-sulfur bacterium that performs anaerobic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation independently in the soil. It is not involved in any symbiotic relationship with mycorrhiza, which is a symbiotic association between fungi and plant roots. Mycorrhiza helps plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil, while the plant provides the fungus with carbohydrates.\n\n(3) Anabaena --- Nitrogen fixer: This is a correct match. Anabaena is a cyanobacterium that can fix atmospheric nitrogen and make it available to other organisms.\n\n(4) Rhizobium --- Alfalfa: This is a correct match. Rhizobium is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that lives in nodules on the roots of leguminous plants like alfalfa. The bacteria provide nitrogen to the plant, and the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates and a protected environment.\n\nTherefore, Rhodospirillum, unlike the other organisms listed, doesn't have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhiza. It's an independent nitrogen fixer living in the soil.",

    ],
    "correct_option_index": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is (2) the smaller the fragment size, the farther it moves.\n\nThis is because of two things:\n\n**1. DNA is negatively charged:** The sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA has a negative charge, so when you put it in an electric field, it gets pulled towards the positive electrode (which is called the anode).\n\n**2. Agarose gel acts like a sieve:** The agarose gel is like a maze with tiny holes. Smaller DNA fragments can wiggle through these holes more easily than larger fragments. So, during gel electrophoresis, the small fragments zip through the gel like little rabbits, while the big fragments are like slow turtles, struggling to get through the maze.\n\nHere's an analogy to help you imagine it:\n\nThink of the DNA fragments as beads of different sizes, and the agarose gel as a strainer with holes of different sizes. When you pour water through the strainer, the small beads (small DNA fragments) will fall through quickly, while the big beads (big DNA fragments) will get stuck and take longer to go through.\n\nSo, the size of the DNA fragment is the main factor that determines how far it moves on the gel. The smaller the fragment, the easier it is for it to move through the agarose maze and reach the end.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is (2) Entomophily.\n\nEntomophily: where pollination relies on attracting and rewarding insects for pollen transfer are attractants and rewards crucial.\n\n**1. Anemophily:** This type of pollination relies on wind to carry pollen grains. Flowers pollinated by wind are often small, inconspicuous, and lack bright colors or strong scents. They produce large amounts of lightweight pollen for wind dispersal. Attractants and rewards are not needed as insects are not involved.\n\n**2. Entomophily:** This type of pollination involves insects or other small animals transferring pollen between flowers. Flowers pollinated by insects are often brightly colored, fragrant, and produce nectar or pollen as rewards for the pollinators. Attractants and rewards are essential to attract and motivate insects to visit the flowers and carry pollen.\n\n**3. Hydrophily:** This type of pollination occurs underwater, where pollen grains are carried by water currents to reach other flowers. The flowers are often small and inconspicuous, submerged in water. Attractants and rewards are not needed as wind or currents transport the pollen.\n\n**4. Cleistogamy:** This type of self-pollination happens within the closed flower bud, without the need for any external agent like wind or animals. Attractants and rewards are not needed as pollination occurs independently inside the flower.",

    "explanation": "The smallest living cells, known without a definite cell wall, pathogenic to plants as well as animals and can survive without oxygen, is: (3) Mycoplasma\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n(1) Bacillus: While they are small and lack a definitive cell wall (have a flexible cell wall instead), most members of the Bacillus genus aren't pathogenic to both plants and animals. They are also obligate aerobes, meaning they require oxygen to survive.\n\n(2) Pseudomonas: Similar to Bacillus, Pseudomonas bacteria have a cell wall structure and often require oxygen for survival. Some species can be pathogenic to plants or animals, but not both.\n\n(4) Nostoc: These are cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria-like organism with chlorophyll that allows them to perform photosynthesis. They typically have cell walls and require oxygen for photosynthesis. While some cyanobacteria have symbiotic relationships with plants, they aren't directly pathogenic.\n\nTherefore, only Mycoplasma fits all the criteria:\n\nSmallest living cells: They are the smallest known prokaryotic organisms, even smaller than many viruses.\n\nNo definite cell wall: They lack a rigid cell wall, giving them unique flexibility and helping them evade certain immune responses.\n\nPathogenic to plants and animals: Mycoplasmas can cause a variety of diseases in both plants and animals, such as citrus greening disease in plants and atypical pneumonia in humans.\n\nCan survive without oxygen: Some Mycoplasma species are facultative anaerobes, meaning they can switch between using oxygen and fermentation for energy production.\n\nSo, the answer is (3) Mycoplasma.

Some areas within the reserve might be designated for restoration activities to improve degraded ecosystems, but it's not a separate zone with specific restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the Core Zone, with its strict legal protection and minimal human interference, is the most accurate answer for the region where no human activity is allowed within a Biosphere Reserve.",

Classic examples include peaches, cherries, and olives. The hard outer shell of the coconut, commonly called the cocoa nut, meets this criteria perfectly.\n\nBerry: Berries have fleshy and juicy inner layers surrounding the seeds. While the white coconut flesh, called copra, might seem fleshy, it's technically classified as a fibrous endosperm and not the characteristic juicy tissue of berries.\n\nNut: While the word \"nut\" is part of the name \"coconut,\" Botanically, nuts are a specific type of dry fruit with a hard shell that develops from a single ovary and typically doesn't split open at maturity. Coconuts don't fully satisfy these criteria, hence their classification as drupes.\n\nCapsule: Capsules are dry fruits that split open along predefined lines or sutures to release seeds. Unlike a capsule, the hard outer shell of the coconut doesn't split naturally to release the seed.\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of a hard outer shell enclosing a single seed, the coconut fruit is accurately classified as a drupe.",

They face challenges due to high salinity and waterlogging. To overcome these, they have developed specific adaptations:\n\nPneumatophores: These are upward-growing projections from the roots that help with gas exchange, providing oxygen to the roots in waterlogged environments where diffusion is limited.\n\nVivipary: In some halophytes, seeds germinate within the fruit while still attached to the parent plant. This reduces the risk of seeds failing to germinate in harsh saline conditions.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n(1) Mesophytes: These are plants adapted to moderate environments with readily available water and nutrients. They typically don't require special adaptations like pneumatophores or vivipary.\n\n(3) Psammophytes: These are plants adapted to sandy habitats. While some might have specific root modifications, they don't generally have pneumatophores or vivipary as prominent features.\n\n(4) Hydrophytes: These are aquatic plants that live in water. They rely on dissolved oxygen and nutrients from the water and don't require pneumatophores for gas exchange. Vivipary is also less common in these environments.\n\nTherefore, the combination of pneumatophores for gas exchange and vivipary for increased success in saline environments are characteristic adaptations of halophytes, making them the correct answer.",

    "explanation": "Among the listed options, the mismatch is: (3) Salvinia -- Heterosporous\n\nHere's why:\n\nPinus (Pine): Dioecious - Correct. Most Pinus species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female cones on different trees.\n\nCycas: Dioecious - Correct. Cycas, commonly known as sago palm, is also dioecious with separate male and female cones.\n\nEquisetum (Horsetail): Homosporous - Correct. Equisetum produces spores that are all alike and can develop into either male or female gametophytes.\n\nSalvinia: Homosporous - This is the mismatch. Salvinia, although often classified as an aquatic fern, actually belongs to a lineage of plants called lycophytes. Unlike Equisetum, Salvinia is heterosporous, meaning it produces two types of spores: megaspores (larger) and microspores (smaller), leading to separate male and female gametophytes.\n\nTherefore, Salvinia, being heterosporous, doesn't align with the homosporous characteristic of Equisetum, making it the option with the mismatch.",

When guard cells contract, their outer walls shorten and thicken, causing the aperture to close.\n\n(2) Decrease in turgidity of guard cells: Similarly, a decrease in turgidity (water pressure) within the guard cells would lead to stomatal closure due to loss of rigidity in the cell walls.\n\n(3) Radial orientation of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall of guard cells: This orientation wouldn't be conducive to opening. Cellulose microfibrils provide strength and rigidity to the cell wall. With radial orientation, they would resist the expansion needed for stomatal opening.\n\nLongitudinal orientation of cellulose microfibrils allows for uneven expansion of the guard cell walls when their turgor increases. This unequal expansion, with more expansion occurring in the direction perpendicular to the cellulose microfibrils, creates a bowing effect that opens the stomata. This specific arrangement of cellulose microfibrils is a crucial adaptation for enabling gas exchange through the stomata.\n\nTherefore, remembering that longitudinal microfibril orientation facilitates stretching and opening of the guard cells will help you identify the correct answer.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is: (2) Negatively charged\n\nDNA fragments, like the double helix itself, are negatively charged due to the presence of phosphate groups attached to the sugar backbone of the molecule. Each phosphate group carries a single negative charge, and their abundance throughout the DNA gives it an overall negative electrostatic charge. This charge plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA packaging, interaction with proteins, and movement within the cell.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n(1) Positively charged: DNA fragments are not positively charged. The positive charges in the molecule come from the nitrogenous bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine), but these are neutralized by the negative charges from the phosphate groups.\n\n(3) Neutral: Overall, DNA fragments are not neutral due to the excess negative charges from the phosphate groups.\n\n(4) Either positively or negatively charged depending on their size: This is not accurate. The charge of DNA fragments is primarily determined by the presence of phosphate groups, which remains constant regardless of size. The size might influence other properties like folding or interaction with specific proteins, but not the overall charge.\n\nTherefore, remembering that the phosphate groups confer a negative charge on DNA fragments and that this charge is independent of their size will help you select the correct answer.",

However, capacitation doesn't take place here.\n\n(3) Vas deferens: This muscular tube transports sperm from the epididymis to the urethra, but it also doesn't involve capacitation.\n\nTherefore, remembering that capacitation requires specific interactions within the female reproductive tract will help you distinguish it from other stages of sperm maturation and select the correct answer.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer to the question \"A disease caused by an autosomal primary non-disjunction is?\" is:\n(1) Down's Syndrome\n\n**Down's Syndrome:** This is caused by an autosomal trisomy, specifically trisomy of chromosome 21. In simple terms, a person with Down's Syndrome has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This is typically due to non-disjunction during meiosis, where the pair of chromosome 21 fails to separate properly, resulting in one gamete with an extra chromosome.\n\n**Klinefelter's Syndrome:** This is caused by an sex chromosomal aneuploidy, resulting in a karyotype of XXY. It's not directly caused by autosomal primary non-disjunction.\n\n**Turner's Syndrome:** This is another sex chromosomal aneuploidy, with a single X chromosome (XO). Similar to Klinefelter's syndrome, it doesn't involve autosomal primary non-disjunction.\n\n**Sickle Cell Anemia:** This is a genetic disorder caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene, not by non-disjunction.\n\nTherefore, remembering that Down's Syndrome is characterized by trisomy of an autosome (chromosome 21) caused by non-disjunction, clearly distinguishes it from the other options and makes it the accurate answer.",

This means the dominant phase is the haploid gametophyte, which produces gametes through mitosis. These gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, which undergoes meiosis directly to produce haploid gametophytes, completing the cycle.\n\n**Fucus:** This brown alga has a diplontic life cycle.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is (3) 33.\n\nHere's how we can reason it out:\n\n**Codons and amino acids:** Each codon in mRNA consists of three bases and codes for one amino acid. Therefore, in this case, 999 bases / 3 bases/codon = 333 codons are needed to code for the 333 amino acids.\n\n**Deletion at position 901:** Deleting the base at position 901 disrupts the reading frame of the mRNA from that point onwards. Every codon downstream of the deleted base will be shifted by one base, effectively becoming a different codon and potentially coding for a different amino acid.\n\n**Number of altered codons:** Since the deletion occurs within the coding region (before the stop codon), all remaining codons (333 - (901-1)/3 = 99) will be altered.\n\nTherefore, deleting the base at position 901 affects the entire remaining coding sequence, resulting in the alteration of 33 codons, not just one or a few.\n\nNote that while the answer (4) might seem tempting with the same number of amino acids, codons and amino acids are separate entities. Deleting a base doesn't change the number of amino acids needed, but it can significantly impact the codons responsible for coding those amino acids.",

This current brings in food and oxygen and carries away waste products.\n\nTherefore, since the question specifically asks about cells lining the spongocoel with flagella, the answer is clearly choanocytes. They play a crucial role in feeding and respiration of sponges, making them distinct from the other options.",

This allows researchers to analyze the size, quantity, and integrity of the separated DNA fragments.\n\nHere's why the other options are not suitable:\n\n(1) Bromophenol blue: This dye, commonly used as a loading dye in gel electrophoresis, migrates with the DNA but doesn't directly stain it.\n\n(2) Acetocarmine: This is a histological stain used for visualizing chromosomes in plant and animal cells, but it's not commonly employed for analyzing DNA fragments on agarose gels.\n\n(3) Aniline blue: This dye is primarily used for staining collagen and cartilage in histological sections and wouldn't effectively stain DNA on agarose gels.\n\nTherefore, remembering that ethidium bromide specifically binds to DNA and readily fluoresces under UV light makes it the ideal choice for visualizing DNA fragments on agarose gels.",

It doesn't contribute to maintaining lung inflation after forceful expiration.\n\n(3) Tidal Volume: This is the volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath. It completely empties during forceful expiration, not contributing to residual air.\n\n(4) Expiratory Reserve Volume: This is the additional volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled after the normal expiration. It is also fully expelled during forceful expiration, not contributing to residual air.\n\nResidual volume, on the other hand, refers to the air that remains in the lungs even after the most forceful expiration. This volume, typically around 1200 mL in adults, helps maintain the shape and structure of the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing. Additionally, the presence of surfactant, a phospholipid film lining the alveoli, further reduces surface tension and contributes to their inflated state.\n\nTherefore, remembering that residual volume is the air remaining in the lungs after complete exhalation explains why lungs maintain their integrity despite forceful expiration.",

This helps retain fluid and maintain blood pressure.\n\n**Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF):** Unlike the other hormones mentioned, ANF is released by the heart in response to high blood pressure and volume. Its primary function is to promote diuresis (increased urine output) and natriuresis (increased sodium excretion), both of which help decrease blood pressure and volume.\n\nTherefore, a decrease in blood pressure/volume would actually trigger the release of renin, aldosterone, and ADH, but it would inhibit the release of ANF.\n\nRemember, the hormone response to changes in blood pressure/volume is a complex interplay to maintain homeostasis. Each hormone has a specific role, and understanding their opposing effects is crucial for interpreting physiological processes.",

    "explanation": "Among the listed statements, the correct one regarding the loop of Henle is:\n(1) The ascending limb of loop of Henle is impermeable to water.\n\nHere's why the other statements are incorrect:\n\n(2) The descending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to water: This statement is actually true. The descending limb is highly permeable to water, allowing it to passively diffuse out into the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium, concentrating the urine in the loop.\n\n(3) The ascending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to water: This statement is false. The ascending limb plays a crucial role in reabsorbing water back into the blood, and this wouldn't be possible if it were permeable to water. It actively pumps out sodium and chloride ions, creating a concentration gradient that drives water reabsorption through aquaporins, proteins that facilitate water movement.\n\n(4) The descending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to electrolytes: This statement is partially true. While the descending limb is permeable to some electrolytes like urea to a limited extent, its main function is water reabsorption, not extensive electrolyte permeability.\n\nTherefore, remembering that the ascending limb's impermeability to water is key for creating the concentration gradient and driving water reabsorption in the loop of Henle helps you identify the correct answer.",

Auxin application can effectively prevent premature fruit and leaf drop in many plant species.\n\nTherefore, option (3) is the most accurate answer for preventing early fruit and leaf drop.\n\nIt's important to note that while auxins are generally effective, the specific type and concentration used may vary depending on the plant species and desired outcome.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is:\n(2) Directional as it pushes the mean of the character in one direction, specifically towards higher milk output.\n\nHere's why:\n\nStabilizing selection works to maintain the existing average trait in a population. In this case, it wouldn't be effective for increasing milk yield.\n\nDisruptive selection favors extreme phenotypes on both ends of the spectrum, potentially creating two distinct subpopulations. While it could lead to some high-yielding individuals, it's not the main goal in this scenario.\n\nStabilizing followed by disruptive doesn't really apply here. The primary aim is to consistently increase milk output, not stabilize and then disrupt the population.\n\nDirectional selection is the most fitting choice. By selecting cows with higher milk yields for breeding, farmers gradually \"push\" the average milk output of the subsequent generations towards higher values. This is the core principle behind using artificial selection to improve desired traits in livestock.\n\nTherefore, aiming for progressively higher milk yield in cows through breeding exemplifies directional selection.",

    "explanation": "This is a first order reaction because the unit of rate constant is s⁻¹.\nFor first order reaction:\nt = (2.303 / k) × log([A]0 / [A])\nHere, [A]0 = 7.2 mol L⁻¹\n[A] = 0.9 mol L⁻¹\nSo, [A]0 / [A] = 7.2 / 0.9 = 8\nlog 8 = log(2^3) = 3 × log 2 = 3 × 0.301 = 0.903\nt = (2.303 / 0.03) × 0.903 \n= 76.767 × 0.903 \n^^= 69.3 seconds^^\n\nAlternatively:\nConcentration reduces to 1/8th, which means 3 half-lives (because 2^3 = 8).\nHalf-life  t1/2 = 0.693 / k = 0.693 / 0.03 = 23.1 s\nTotal time = 3 × 23.1 = 69.3 seconds\nFinal answer is 69.3 seconds.",

Marchantia and Riccia are liverworts that do not form significant peat deposits. Funaria is a common moss but not associated with peat formation. Sphagnum's ability to hold water and create acidic conditions makes it the key contributor to peat, used as fuel or horticultural material.",

Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can be unicellular (like yeast) or multicellular (like molds and mushrooms), and they are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment. However, their cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, glucans, and other polysaccharides, not purely cellulose as seen in plant cell walls. Cellulose may be present in some fungal groups but is not universal or the main component, making this statement incorrect.",

However, their cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, glucans, and other polysaccharides, not purely cellulose as seen in plant cell walls. Cellulose may be present in some fungal groups but is not universal or the main component, making this statement incorrect.",
